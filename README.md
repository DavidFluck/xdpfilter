## Build and run
```
make
sudo ./xdpfilter
```

## Introduction
This application uses XDP to drop packets from hosts that send a certain amount of SYN packets within a certain time period.

## Dependencies

pkg-config
make
llvm/clang
gcc
m4
Remap llc-12, llvm-strip-12, etc. to their non-versioned names.

### libbpf

I vendor libbpf as a submodule. Some package repositories provide it, but vendoring ensures that this code will always use a more up-to-date version.

### xdp-tools

Similarly, I vendor xdp-tools as a submodule, although that's more out of necessity to provide libxdp, because, at least, the Ubuntu repositories don't seem to have it packaged. Therefore, building it is required.

### The Algorithm
At first, I explored a few different ways of counting SYN requests and determining how many occurred within a sliding window, such as a ring buffer with a certain number of buckets representing slices of a time period. This works fine, but as I explored it further, I became concerned with the amount of space the bookkeeping would require, especially if a bad actor decided to send a large number of packets.

Instead, I did some more research and found an interesting solution that [Cloudflare had written about](https://blog.cloudflare.com/counting-things-a-lot-of-different-things/), which involves keeping track of packet counts (per host) for just two time periods: a "current" period and a "previous" period. Then, to compute an approximation of the sliding window, you multiply the count of events in the previous time period with the percentage of the previous time period that is no longer "relevant". For example, if the sampling period is one minute, and you're already 20 seconds into the current minute, the previous minute's count would be multiplied by 0.67 (67%). Finally, you add the total count in the current time period to that value, and that's your count approximation for the sliding window. Cloudflare provides a helpful image:

For Cloudflare's example, the arithmetic looks like this:

```
rate = 42 * ((60-15)/60) + 18
     = 42 * 0.75 + 18
     = 49.5 requests
```

This method rests on a few assumptions, such as expecting that you receive packets relatively uniformly, but Cloudflare notes that, in practice, it works remarkably well. In my opinion, one nice feature of this algorithm is that your time windows can easily be any arbitrary size, and you only ever need two of them, since you only have to maintain a previous and a current count per host.

## The Implementation

### Userland
I decided to do the userland portion in C, partially because it made using libbpf easier, and partially because I haven't written userland C in a while and I really enjoy it.

I leaned heavily on blog posts and reference material by Andrii Nakryiko, who is one of the authors (if not _the_ author) of libbpf. He also maintains a set of tools called [libbpf-bootstrap](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf-bootstrap), which provides skeletons and helpful functionality for getting started with libbpf. I used the `bootstrap` example of libbpf-bootstrap to scaffold out this project.
